Filtering out genes outside of the main genome

It is not so easy to separate plastid and mitochondrial genes from nuclear genes, as sometimes proteins active in the organelles are stored in the nucleus. I tried first by simply removing all genes with an annotation containing the words "chloroplast", "mitochondrial" or "ribosomal", but this seemed a leaky method. Genes from the photosystem, for example, are located in the chloroplast but this is not mentioned in the annotation. Therefore, I was not actively removing them from my set of genes.

It is key to properly filter out non-nuclear genes, since they will otherwise come out as the main large gene-families in our analysis. So I decided to try another approach - use uniprot annotations to properly remove genes located in the organelles.

To do this, I had to return to the annotation file from Blast2Go to obtain gene IDs from other assemblies that blasted to my gene models. I can then search these genes in the uniprot database, and select all those that are located outside of the nucleus.
