# Studying adaptive sequence evolution and relaxation in paralogous genes

One interesting aspect about gene duplication is the possibility of neofunctionalization, where one of the two gene copies goes through rapid sequence evolution and obtains a novel function. Generally, the fate of paralogs is unknown in Tillandsia, and can be interesting to investigate (neofunctionalization vs pseudogenization). Therefore, we want to explore coding sequence evolution in these genes within our capacities by estimating dN/dS values for these sequences.

Working with paralogous genes comes with a number of challenges. First of all, it is not straightforward to know the inner relationships within a multi-copy orthogroup. It is important to know which genes originated from duplication and this is difficult to figure out. Secondly, it is unclear if differences in gene copies between species arise from gene loss or gene gain, which are two very different evolutionary processes. Therefore, we will only work with small subsets of paralogs, where relationships are kept very simple (2-1, 1-2) and where we have evidence of the inner relationships in the orthogroup.

# 1. Identification of resolved paralogous relationships

Orthofinder (see Orthology section) doesn't just infer orthogroups, but in some cases also orthologs. This means that Orthofinder can, in some cases, resolve the inner relationships of orthogroups and subcategorize it into orthologs.
