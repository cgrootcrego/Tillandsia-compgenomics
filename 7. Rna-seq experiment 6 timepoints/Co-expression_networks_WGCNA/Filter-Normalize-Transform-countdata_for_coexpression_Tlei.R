# In this script, we evaluate, filter, normalize and trim count data so that it is ready for
# building a coexpression network. We use DESeq2 for normalization, low-expression filtering
# and transformation. We test several filtering thresholds and transformations. Then, using the
# WGCNA package, we set the data up for coexpression analysis.
