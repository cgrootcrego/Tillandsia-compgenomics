# Inferring Gene Family Evolution between *T. fasciculata* and *T. leiboldiana*

Using the inferred gene models of both reference genomes, we can get a first idea of which gene families have changed in size between the two species. However, before looking at the families with greatest changes, some filtering of faulty gene models has to be done first, especially for the *T. fasciculata* annotation.

# Detecting faulty gene models resulting from haplotigs in *T. fasciculata*

*T. fasciculata* is a wide-spread species, often regarded as a species complex, with very high levels of heterozygosity. Unsurprisingly, the accession used for our *T. fasciculata* reference genome was also more heterozygous than desired for genome assemblu. 
Using 50x whole genome sequencing data of our reference genome accession, we can look at coverage across the genome, and more importantly across gene models.
